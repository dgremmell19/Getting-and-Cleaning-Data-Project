#**Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project**

##Information

This repo contains information related to the John Hopkins University Project on Getting and Cleaning Data. 

## Project Objectives

#####Create an R Script That:
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

##File Overview

1. run_analysis.R - R file used to run code to download data to working directory, unzip and perform data cleaning. 
2. CodeBook.md - Markdown file that describes variables in the data set. 
3. tidydata.txt - Output file of tidy data from running R code.
4. README.md - Current file for providing project overview, file list and information. 

##Instructions

1. Open README.md and read information and instructions. 
2. Open CodeBook.md and review variable names and keep open for reference. 
3. Open run_analysis.R in R or R Studio.Set working directory if necessary. 
4. Simply execute the R Code. There is no need to pre-download data. The R code will download the data set,
unzip to the current working directory, perform the data cleaning process and write a text file to the 
current working directory called tidydata.txt. The code is flexible. 
5. tidydata.txt is included here for reference only. Each time the R code is ran, the output will be tidydata.txt.
